# CSS Cardio: Web Clones
![Clones, clones everywhere](assets/clones_hero.jpg)


> CSS Cardio projects are design focused monthly ventures where the goal is to write a clone of existing website from scratch without checking the original solution. You like the idea? Check it, fork it, start adding your stuff and have fun while doing it.

<br>

## Rules & Guidelines
- Primary goal is to recreate existing web site/app as close to the original as possible
- Focus is more on design but whenever possible, functionality should also be considered
- Looking at source code of original project should be avoided 
  - It can only be checked for:
    - Font families
    - Colors
- **When choosing technologies:**
  - CSS Libraries and frameworks should be avoided except in cases where the project goal is to learn particular framework
  - JS Frameworks and CSS preprocessors should be considered to use and learn
  - It's good idea to decide on "tech stack" when planning clone project and force lesser known technologies to learn and reinforce them
    - Example: _For this project I will only use CSS grid for layout and Sass for CSS._
- **When looking at original site content:**
    - Registered names, trademark images and original site assets should be avoided
    - Placeholder images and text are suggested or recreating original assets by changing the content
      - For example, while doing Netflix clone name can be changed to "Webflix" or "Netfix"
- One clone per month can be considered as a healthy CSS cardio routine
